-   What is it?
    -   Version control system
    -   Collaboration tool
    -   Can be powerful for transparency and reproducibility
    -   More to come
-   Think of a GitHub profile as a public resume and treat it as such
-   [Username advice](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html) from Jenny Bryan

. . .

Git might be frustrating, but we'll get through it together!

# Welcome to `R` !

## What is `R` {.smaller}

-   `R` is an environment and programming language, created primarily for statistical analyses and graphics
-   No point-and-click interface
-   Open source
    -   source code is freely available, and can be redistributed and modified
-   Incredibly powerful and flexible
    -   Vast array of external packages available for specialized functions (analyses, data visualizations, automate the data "cleaning" process)

> The bad news is that whenever you learn a new skill you're going to suck. It's going to be frustrating. The good news is that is typical and happens to everyone and it is only temporary. You can't go from knowing nothing to becoming an expert without going through a period of great frustration and great suckiness.

-- Hadley Wickham

## Moving to code/programming {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Advantages**

* Flexibility 
    + Essentially anything is possible
* Transparency 
    + Documented history of your analysis 
* Efficiency 
    + Many tasks can be automated
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Disadvantages**

-   Steep learning curve
    -   Definitely requires a significant time investment
    -   Similar to learning a new language
-   You will lose patience with point-and-click interfaces
-   Likely to become "one of the converted"

:::

## Code-based Interface

This is the `R` console

![](./images/console.png)

## Code-based Interface

This is the RStudio IDE *(Integrated Development Environment)*

![](./images/ide.png)

## How to learn `R`?

-   Time
-   Use it!
-   Dedication and determination help
-   Be patient and forgiving with yourself, it will feel slow at first
-   I still get frustrated

## `R` as a big calculator

```{r}
#| echo: true
3 + 2
```

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true
3 / (3+2)
```

## Object Assignment `<-` {.smaller}

Objects are stored in active memory of your computer with names that you provide

. . .

`<-` is the assignment operator

. . .

It is used to assign names to objects (like an `=` operator)

. . .

```{r, echo=TRUE}
a <- 3
b <- 2
a
```

. . .

```{r, echo=TRUE}
a + b
```

. . .

```{r, echo=TRUE}
a / (a + b)
```

## Re-assignment

```{r}
#| echo: true
a
```

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true
a <- 10
a
```

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true
a <- "EDLD 651"
a
```

## Data Types {.smaller}

Data can be a variety of types

. . .

-   **character**: `"Hello world!"` or `"EDLD 651"`

. . .

-   **numeric**: `2` and/or `15.5`
    - decimal also called `double`

. . .

-   **integer**: `2` 
    - whole number also called an `integer`
    - explicit about an integer `2L` (the `L` tells `R` to store this as an integer) ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

. . .

-   **logical**: `TRUE` or `FALSE`

. . .

These objects can be extremely useful in programming

## Objects {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Objects can also be:

-   variables
-   data sets
-   models
-   results
-   functions
-   figures
-   more...
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
You can then use or manipulate these in different ways

-   plots
-   functions
-   operators (arithmetic, logical, comparison)

:::
:::

## `R` Functions {.smaller}

Anything that carries out an operation in `R` is a function, even `+`

Functions are generally followed by `()`

-   **`function_name()`**

    -   `sum()`
    -   `lm()`
    -   `sqrt()`

. . .

**`function_name()` == `package_name::function_name()`**

the package is also called the "namespace"

## Getting help

`?` before a function name can be very helpful (and also confusing early on)

. . .

-   Helpful for understanding formal *arguments* of a function
    -   *arguments* are options within a `function()`

. . .

`?function_name()`

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
?mutate() #mutate() is a function in the {dplyr} package

?dplyr::mutate()
```

. . .

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

?mean
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts {.smaller}

#### There are a lot...

**Tools > Keyboard Shortcuts Help** (`Alt + Shift + K`)

**Tools > Modify Keyboard Shortcuts**

. . .

My favorites (for Macs, sub `Command` for `Ctrl`)

1.   `Ctrl + Enter` = run code
2.   `Ctrl + Shift + M` = insert pipe (`%>%`)
3.  `Ctrl + Alt + I` = insert code chunk in R Markdown
4.   `Ctrl + Shift + C` = comment a block

. . .

Other good ones

-   `Alt + -` = insert assignment operator (\<-)
-   `Alt + Shift + Up/Down` = add cursor above/below current cursor

# `R` Packages

## The data science pipeline

![](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/diagrams/data-science/base.png)

::: aside
[R4DS(2e)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/diagrams/data-science/base.png)
:::

. . .

#### How do we go about this?

## "Out of the box" functionality {.smaller}

`R` Packages provide functions (and datasets) for you to use

Some packages are pre-loaded: no need to load (`library(base)`), you can use all of their functions anytime

-   `{base}`
-   `{graphics}`
-   `{stats}`

Some packages are pre-installed: you just need to load the package (`library(MASS)`) or use the namespace (`MASS::cats`)

-   `{boot}`
-   `{MASS}`
-   `{Matrix}`

## Pre-loaded vs Installed

Pre-loaded packages work on launch

For example, `plot()` is part of the `{graphics}` package, which ships with `R` . . .

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| fig-height: 5
plot(x = 1:10, y = 1:10)
```

## `{base}` package

-   All functions come from a package

. . .

-   What do you get with the following?

`?'+'`

## 

![](./images/plus_help.png)

## Packages on CRAN {.smaller}

There is a TON of functionality that comes with R right from your initial download **BUT** the functionality can be extended by installing other packages

. . .

CRAN is the official repository 

* a network of servers maintained by the R community around the world
* coordinated by the [R Foundation](https://www.r-project.org/foundation/)
* a package needs to pass several tests to be published on CRAN

. . .

Most often, you will first install a package, then load it

* `install.packages(“package_name”)`
* `library(package_name)`

. . .

You will only need to install a package **once** (generally). After that, it is in your library and only needs to be loaded

## One more time {.smaller}

. . .

`install.packages(“package_name”)`

. . .

-   you will only need to do this the **FIRST** time you use the package
-   don't keep this code line (just run it in the console!)
-   notices the quotes around the package name

. . .

`library(package_name)`

. . .

-   you will do this **every** time you use the package in your scripts
-   notices no quotes

## Other packages

On GitHub

-   Popular repository for open source projects
    -   Integrated with git (version control)
    -   Easy to share/collaborate
-   Not necessarily `R` specific
-   Generally, these packages "in development," or are the beta versions of existing packages
-   No review process associated with GitHub

## Possibilities

With just a basic knowledge of `R` you have access to thousands of packages

-   Expanding on a daily basis
    + Currently, the CRAN package repository features 19,900+ packages
    + 18,700+ last year at this time
    + constantly evolving to keep up with the varied demands of the data science community
-   Provides access to cutting edge and specialized functionality for analysis, data visualization, and data preparation
-   Some of the most modern thinking on data analysis topics are often represented in these packages

# Let's dive in

(or end here for today)

## How do we access variables (columns) in our data?

-   Generally, in this course, with `{tidyverse}` tools

. . .

-   Sometimes with `base` using `$` or with `[]`
    -   `data_name$variable_name`
    -   `data_name["variable_name"]`

## Some data {.smaller}

Let's load the `{tidyverse}`, and then we'll access some variables from the data sets within the packages

Then let's take a `glimpse` at the `gss_cat` data which loads with `tidyverse`

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true

# install.packages(“tidyverse”) 
## if you have never installed {tidyverse} you'll need to do that first
library(tidyverse)

glimpse(gss_cat)
```

## Selecting varaibles

Select the `marital` variable with `$`

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
gss_cat$marital
```

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: false
gss_cat$marital
```


## Look at the `str`ucture of an object

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
str(gss_cat)
```

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: false
str(gss_cat)
```

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
str(gss_cat$marital)
```

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: false
str(gss_cat$marital)
```

## Because `gss_cat` is a `tibble`

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
gss_cat
```

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: false
gss_cat
```

## When to use `$`?

-   Often when you need to use `{base} R`
-   Execute a function casually

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true
table(gss_cat$marital)
```

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true
hist(gss_cat$age)
```

## Your turn

Run `table()` on the *religion* variable in `gss_cat`

Produce a `hist`ogram of the *tvhours* variable in `gss_cat`

## The pipe operator (`%>%`)

-   The `%>%` operator (`Ctrl + Shift + M`) inserts the input from the left as the first argument in the next function
-   To start, you can read it as, "then"
-   It is crucial for work in the `{tidyverse}`

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true
gss_cat %>% 
  count(marital)
```

. . .

We will talk about this a lot more later

## Quick aside

Base `R` has a native pipe now!

R 4.1.0 introduced a native pipe operator, `|>`. As described in the R News:

> R now provides a simple native forward pipe syntax `|>`. The simple form of the forward pipe inserts the left-hand side as the first argument in the right-hand side call. 

The behavior of the native pipe is basically the same as the `%>%` pipe  (from the `{magrittr}` package)

Luckily there’s no need to commit entirely to one pipe or the other — you can use the base pipe for the majority of cases where it’s sufficient and use the magrittr pipe when you really need its special features.

More [here](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2023/04/base-vs-magrittr-pipe/#-vs).

## Why use `%>%`

Chaining arguments is **efficient** and **easy to read**

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true

gss_cat %>% 
  filter(relig == "Buddhism",
         age > 55) %>% 
  select(age, partyid, rincome) %>% 
  arrange(age) %>% 
  slice(1:4)
```

. . .

**Equivalent to:**

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

slice(arrange(select(filter(gss_cat, relig == "Buddhism", age > 55), age, partyid, rincome), age), 1:5)
```
