All courses will be taught through R, a free and open-source statistical computing environment. This course will introduce students toR and RStudio, version control with git and GitHub, dynamic and reproducible workflows with Quarto, and basic data wrangling and visualization with the tidyverse suite of packages.\nThis course, and much of the materials prepared and content presented, was originally developed by Daniel Anderson. In collaboration with Daniel Anderson, Alison Hill, Chester Ismay, and Andrew Bray, helped design the content for this course and the specialization as a whole.\n\n\n\nBy the end of this course, students should be able to:\n\nUnderstand the R package ecosystem (how to find, install, load, and learn about package functionality)\nRead “flat” (i.e., rectangular) datasets into R\nPerform basic data wrangling and transformations in R, using the tidyverse\n\nLeverage appropriate functions for introductory data science tasks (pipeline)\n“clean up” the dataset using scripts and reproducible workflows\n\nUse version control with R via GitHub\nUse Quarto to create reproducible, dynamic reports\nUnderstand and create different types of data visualizations\n\n\n\n\nThis is an in-person course: that means that, unlike asynchronous online/ASYNC WEB courses, we will meet during scheduled class meeting times in (class location). I will accommodate absences as described in the Absences policy below. If you need additional flexibility, UO encourages you to consider ASYNC WEB courses. If you need accommodation related to a medical or other disability, you can request those by working with the Accessible Education Center.\n\n\n\nAll required course readings are freely available online or will be provided by the instructor.

At 13 points each, these homeworks will be scored on a “best honest effort” basis, which generally implies zero or full credit (i.e., the assignment was or was not fully completed). However, many of the homework assignments require students complete specific portions before moving on to the next sections. If you find yourself stuck and unable to proceed, please contact the instructor for help rather than submitting incomplete work. Contacting the instructor is part of the “best honest effort”, and can result in full credit for an assignment even if the work is not fully complete. If the assignment is not complete, and the student has not contacted the instructor for help, it is likely to result is a score of zero.\nIf your homework is not submitted prior to the start of the following class without approval from the instructor, it will receive at most 7 points when/if it is submitted. If your homework is submitted more than two weeks late, it will receive zero points.\n\n\nSupplemental Learning Platforms (70 points)\n\nCodecademy-Learn R\nIn addition to providing supplemental support, seven Codecademy Lessons will be assigned and scored as part of homework at 10 points each.

    "text": "Final Project (200 points; 50%)\nThe final project in this class is a group project, requiring students use a “real world” dataset to write, essentially, a miniature manuscript, including an introduction (paragraph or two), methods, results, and discussion (again, maybe 2-3 paragraphs). Ideally, students would work with a dataset that includes variables they are interested in using beyond just this class; however, if students do not have access to a dataset, the instructor will provide one. Students who do not have access to data should plan to meet with the instructor as soon as possible so a dataset can be provided. Additionally, the dataset must be able to be shared publicly, as the full project will be required to be housed on GitHub and be fully reproducible. If making your data publicly available is a problem for you, please contact the instructor as soon as possible. We can work together to either find a dataset that will work for you, or simulate a dataset that is similar to the data you’d like to work with in reality (and then all your code should work for the real dataset, but you can share the simulated data with your classmates). Students are required to work in groups of 2-4 people. The final assignment is assigned during the first class, and groups must be finalized by the end of Week 2 (at which point students who have not self-selected into groups will be randomly assigned).\n\nOutline (15 points)\nA basic outline of the final project is due at the end of Week 5. The outline should include a description of the data to be used, a discussion of what preparatory work will need to be done, and how the requirements of the final project will be met. The outline is intended to be low-stakes and is primarily designed to be a means for you to obtain feedback on the feasibility of the project and areas to consider.\n\n\nDraft Data Preparation Script (25 points)\nAt the end of Week 8, you must have a draft of the data preparation complete, including moving the data from its raw to tidy form and a variety of exploratory data visualizations. Final project must use the following functions: pivot_longer(), select(), filter(), mutate(), pivot_wider(), group_by(), and summarize().\n\n\nPeer Review of Data Preparation Script (25 points)\nFollowing the submission of the data preparation scripts, you will be assigned to review your peers’ code. The purpose of this exercise is to learn from each other. Programming is an immensely open-ended enterprise and there are lots of winding paths that all ultimately end up at the same destination. During your peer review, you must note (a) at least three areas of strength, (b) at least one thing you learned from reviewing their script, and (c) at least one and no more than three areas for improvement. Making your code publicly available can feel daunting. The purpose of this portion of the final project is to help us all learn from each other, not to denigrate. Under no circumstances will negative comments be tolerated. Any comments that could be perceived as negative, and outside the scope of the code, will result in an immediate score of zero. Be constructive in your feedback. Be kind. We are all learning.\n\n\nFinal Project Presentation (25 points)\nEach group will present on their final project during Week 10, which is expected to still be in progress. These presentations are expected to be informal, and emphasize what learning occurred during the project. Specifically, the presentations are to commiserate with each other about the failures and challenges experienced along the way, while also celebrating the successes. Learning R is a difficult task, and we should all take solace knowing that others are struggling along with us. The final presentation should be equal parts “journey” and substantive findings/conclusions/results. Students are expected to present for approximately 10 minutes each (20-40 minutes per group), although the time may change depending on the enrollment of the class.\n\n\nFinal Paper (110)\nThe purpose of the final project is to allow students an opportunity to demonstrate all the skills they have learned throughout the course. The final project must (a) be a reproducible and dynamic R Markdown document with references to the extant literature; (b) be housed on GitHub, with contributions from all authors obvious; (c) demonstrate moving data from its raw “messy” format to a tidy data format through the R Markdown file, but not in the final document; (d) include at least two exploratory data visualizations, and (e) include at least summary statistics of the data in tables, although fitted models of any sort are an added bonus (not literally, there are not extra points for fitting a model). The points for the final project are broken down as follows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Paper Rubric\n\n\nCriteria\nPoints Possible\n\n\n\n\nWriting\n\n\n\nAbstract\n5\n\n\nIntroduction\n5\n\n\nMethods\n5\n\n\nResults\n5\n\n\nDiscussion\n5\n\n\nReferences\n5\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\nDocument is fully reproducible\n25\n\n\nDemonstrate use of inline code\n5\n\n\nAt least two data visualizations\n10 (5 pts each)\n\n\nDemonstrate tidying messy data using:\n\n\n\npivot_longer()\n5\n\n\nmutate()\n5\n\n\nselect()`` and ``filter()\n5\n\n\npivot_wider()\n5\n\n\nAt least one table of descriptive statistics\n10\n\n\ngroup_by()\n5\n\n\nsummarize()\n5\n\n\nTotal\n110\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI will investigate the commits made by different authors when evaluating the final project. If it is obvious that one person did not utilize GitHub, and instead added all of their contributions through a single or only a few commits, I will dock points from that individual. There should be numerous commits by each author, and they should be roughly even in terms of contribution activity (which GitHub has metrics to track, both in terms of the number of commits as well as the number of lines modified)."

This entails preparing, following instructions, and engaging respectfully and thoughtfully with others. While all students should participate, participation is not just talking, and a range of participation activities support learning. Participation might look like speaking aloud in the full class and in small groups as well as submitting questions prior to class or engaging with Discussion posts. We will establish more specific participation guidelines and criteria for contributions in our first weeks of the term.\nExpect and Respect Diversity: All classes at the University of Oregon welcome and respect diverse experiences, perspectives, and approaches. What is not welcome are behaviors or contributions that undermine, demean, or marginalize others based on race, ethnicity, gender, sex, age, sexual orientation, religion, ability, or socioeconomic status. We will value differences and communicate disagreements with respect. We may establish more specific guidelines and protocols to ensure inclusion and equity for all members of our learning community.\nHelp Everyone Learn: Part of how we learn together is by learning from one another. To do this effectively, we need to be patient with each other, identify ways we can assist others, and be open-minded to receiving help and feedback from others. Don’t hesitate to contact me to ask for assistance or offer suggestions that might help us learn better.\nGuidelines for using Canvas Discussion:\n\nUse subject lines that clearly communicate the content of your post - Write concisely, and be aware that humor or sarcasm doesn’t always translate in writing.\nBe supportive and considerate when replying to others’ posts. This means avoiding use of jargon or inappropriate language, and it means disagreeing with respect and providing clear rationale or evidence to support your different view.\n\nKeep focused on the topic and reference readings and other class materials to support your points (as applicable).\n\nTry to use correct spelling and grammar and proofread your submissions. After submitting, use the edit feature to make corrections and resubmit (don’t create a new or duplicate post that corrects your error)."

In certain cases, as part of your documentation, I may ask you to submit any GenAI results you obtained, so you need to keep GenAI-created drafts and logs of your interactions with GenAI tools; failure to provide such documentation may result in a grade reduction in certain instances.\nAlong with documentation of your GenAI use, you are also required to cite GenAI if you use any GenAI-created content in your work submissions, for example text or images or graphics generated by GenAI tools.

If you need general resources on coping with stress or want to talk with another student who has been in the same place as you, visit the Duck Nest (located in the EMU on the ground floor) and get help from one of the specially trained Peer Wellness Advocates.\nUniversity Counseling Services (UCS) has a team of dedicated staff members to support you with your concerns, many of whom can provide identity-based support.

This course will introduce students toR and RStudio, version control with git and GitHub, dynamic and reproducible workflows with Quarto, and basic data wrangling and visualization with the tidyverse suite of packages.\nThis course, and much of the materials prepared and content presented, was originally developed by Daniel Anderson. In collaboration with Daniel Anderson, Alison Hill, Chester Ismay, and Andrew Bray, helped design the content for this course and the specialization as a whole."

Ideally, students would work with a dataset that includes variables they are interested in using beyond just this class; however, if students do not have access to a dataset, the instructor will provide one. Students who do not have access to data should plan to meet with the instructor as soon as possible so a dataset can be provided. Additionally, the dataset must be able to be shared publicly, as the full project will be required to be housed on GitHub and be fully reproducible. If making your data publicly available is a problem for you, please contact the instructor as soon as possible. We can work together to either find a dataset that will work for you, or simulate a dataset that is similar to the data you’d like to work with in reality (and then all your code should work for the real dataset, but you can share the simulated data with your classmates). Students are required to work in groups of 2-4 people. The final assignment is assigned during the first class, and groups must be finalized by the end of Week 2 (at which point students who have not self-selected into groups will be randomly assigned).\nI will investigate the commits made by different authors when evaluating the final project. If it is obvious that one person did not utilize GitHub, and instead added all of their contributions through a single or only a few commits, I will dock points from that individual. There should be numerous commits by each author, and they should be roughly even in terms of contribution activity (which GitHub has metrics to track, both in terms of the number of commits as well as the number of lines modified).  \n\n\nOutline (15 points)\nA basic outline of the final project is due at the end of Week 5. The outline should include a description of the data to be used, a discussion of what preparatory work will need to be done, and how the requirements of the final project will be met. The outline is intended to be low-stakes and is primarily designed to be a means for you to obtain feedback on the feasibility of the project and areas to consider.  \n\n\nDraft Data Preparation Script (25 points)\nAt the end of Week 8, you must have a draft of the data preparation complete, including moving the data from its raw to tidy form and a variety of exploratory data visualizations. Final project must use the following functions: pivot_longer(), select(), filter(), mutate(), pivot_wider(), group_by(), and summarize().  \n\n\nPeer Review of Data Preparation Script (25 points)\nFollowing the submission of the data preparation scripts, you will be assigned to review your peers’ code. The purpose of this exercise is to learn from each other. Programming is an immensely open-ended enterprise and there are lots of winding paths that all ultimately end up at the same destination. During your peer review, you must note (a) at least three areas of strength, (b) at least one thing you learned from reviewing their script, and (c) at least one and no more than three areas for improvement. Making your code publicly available can feel daunting. The purpose of this portion of the final project is to help us all learn from each other, not to denigrate. Under no circumstances will negative comments be tolerated. Any comments that could be perceived as negative, and outside the scope of the code, will result in an immediate score of zero. Be constructive in your feedback. Be kind. We are all learning.  \n\n\nFinal Project Presentation (25 points)\nEach group will present on their final project during Week 10, which is expected to still be in progress. These presentations are expected to be informal, and emphasize what learning occurred during the project. Specifically, the presentations are to commiserate with each other about the failures and challenges experienced along the way, while also celebrating the successes. Learning R is a difficult task, and we should all take solace knowing that others are struggling along with us. The final presentation should be equal parts “journey” and substantive findings/conclusions/results. Students are expected to present for approximately 10 minutes each (20-40 minutes per group), although the time may change depending on the enrollment of the class.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresentation Rubric\n\n\nCriteria\nPoints possible\n\n\n\n\nChallenges faced along the way\n5\n\n\nVictories and things to celebrate\n5\n\n\nChallenges you are still facing\n5\n\n\nSubstantive findings/interpretations\n5\n\n\nNext R hurdle to tackle\n5\n\n\nTotal\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Paper (110)\nThe purpose of the final project is to allow students an opportunity to demonstrate all the skills they have learned throughout the course. The final project must (a) be a reproducible and dynamic R Markdown document with references to the extant literature; (b) be housed on GitHub, with contributions from all authors obvious; (c) demonstrate moving data from its raw “messy” format to a tidy data format through the R Markdown file, but not in the final document; (d) include at least two exploratory data visualizations, and (e) include at least summary statistics of the data in tables, although fitted models of any sort are an added bonus (not literally, there are not extra points for fitting a model). The points for the final project are broken down as follows.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Paper Rubric\n\n\nCriteria\nPoints Possible\n\n\n\n\nWriting\n\n\n\nAbstract\n5\n\n\nIntroduction\n5\n\n\nMethods\n5\n\n\nResults\n5\n\n\nDiscussion\n5\n\n\nReferences\n5\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\nDocument is fully reproducible\n25\n\n\nDemonstrate use of inline code\n5\n\n\nAt least two data visualizations\n10 (5 pts each)\n\n\nDemonstrate tidying messy data using:\n\n\n\npivot_longer()\n5\n\n\nmutate()\n5\n\n\nselect() and filter()\n5\n\n\npivot_wider()\n5\n\n\nAt least one table of descriptive statistics\n10\n\n\ngroup_by()\n5\n\n\nsummarize()\n5\n\n\nTotal\n110"
