Contacting the instructor is part of the ‚Äúbest honest effort‚Äù, and can result in full credit for an assignment even if the work is not fully complete. If the assignment is not complete, and the student has not contacted the instructor for help, it is likely to result is a score of zero.\nIf your homework is not submitted prior to the start of the following class without approval from the instructor, it will receive at most 7 points when/if it is submitted.

    "section": "Final Project (200 points; 50%)",
    "text": "Final Project (200 points; 50%)\nThe final project in this class is a group project, requiring students use a ‚Äúreal world‚Äù dataset to write, essentially, a miniature manuscript, including an introduction (paragraph or two), methods, results, and discussion (again, maybe 2-3 paragraphs). Ideally, students would work with a dataset that includes variables they are interested in using beyond just this class; however, if students do not have access to a dataset, the instructor will provide one. Students who do not have access to data should plan to meet with the instructor as soon as possible so a dataset can be provided. Additionally, the dataset must be able to be shared publicly, as the full project will be required to be housed on GitHub and be fully reproducible. If making your data publicly available is a problem for you, please contact the instructor as soon as possible. We can work together to either find a dataset that will work for you, or simulate a dataset that is similar to the data you‚Äôd like to work with in reality (and then all your code should work for the real dataset, but you can share the simulated data with your classmates). Students are required to work in groups of 2-4 people. The final assignment is assigned during the first class, and groups must be finalized by the end of Week 2 (at which point students who have not self-selected into groups will be randomly assigned).\n\nOutline (15 points)\nA basic outline of the final project is due at the end of Week 5. The outline should include a description of the data to be used, a discussion of what preparatory work will need to be done, and how the requirements of the final project will be met. The outline is intended to be low-stakes and is primarily designed to be a means for you to obtain feedback on the feasibility of the project and areas to consider.\n\n\nDraft Data Preparation Script (25 points)\nAt the end of Week 8, you must have a draft of the data preparation complete, including moving the data from its raw to tidy form and a variety of exploratory data visualizations. Final project must use the following functions: pivot_longer(), select(), filter(), mutate(), pivot_wider(), group_by(), and summarize().\n\n\nPeer Review of Data Preparation Script (25 points)\nFollowing the submission of the data preparation scripts, you will be assigned to review your peers‚Äô code. The purpose of this exercise is to learn from each other. Programming is an immensely open-ended enterprise and there are lots of winding paths that all ultimately end up at the same destination. During your peer review, you must note (a) at least three areas of strength, (b) at least one thing you learned from reviewing their script, and (c) at least one and no more than three areas for improvement. Making your code publicly available can feel daunting. The purpose of this portion of the final project is to help us all learn from each other, not to denigrate. Under no circumstances will negative comments be tolerated. Any comments that could be perceived as negative, and outside the scope of the code, will result in an immediate score of zero. Be constructive in your feedback. Be kind. We are all learning.\n\n\nFinal Project Presentation (25 points)\nEach group will present on their final project during Week 10, which is expected to still be in progress. These presentations are expected to be informal, and emphasize what learning occurred during the project. Specifically, the presentations are to commiserate with each other about the failures and challenges experienced along the way, while also celebrating the successes. Learning R is a difficult task, and we should all take solace knowing that others are struggling along with us. The final presentation should be equal parts ‚Äújourney‚Äù and substantive findings/conclusions/results. Students are expected to present for approximately 10 minutes each (20-40 minutes per group), although the time may change depending on the enrollment of the class.\n\n\nFinal Paper (110)\nThe purpose of the final project is to allow students an opportunity to demonstrate all the skills they have learned throughout the course. The final project must (a) be a reproducible and dynamic R Markdown document with references to the extant literature; (b) be housed on GitHub, with contributions from all authors obvious; (c) demonstrate moving data from its raw ‚Äúmessy‚Äù format to a tidy data format through the R Markdown file, but not in the final document; (d) include at least two exploratory data visualizations, and (e) include at least summary statistics of the data in tables, although fitted models of any sort are an added bonus (not literally, there are not extra points for fitting a model). The points for the final project are broken down as follows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Paper Rubric\n\n\nCriteria\nPoints Possible\n\n\n\n\nWriting\n\n\n\nAbstract\n5\n\n\nIntroduction\n5\n\n\nMethods\n5\n\n\nResults\n5\n\n\nDiscussion\n5\n\n\nReferences\n5\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\nDocument is fully reproducible\n25\n\n\nDemonstrate use of inline code\n5\n\n\nAt least two data visualizations\n10 (5 pts each)\n\n\nDemonstrate tidying messy data using:\n\n\n\npivot_longer()\n5\n\n\nmutate()\n5\n\n\nselect()`` and ``filter()\n5\n\n\npivot_wider()\n5\n\n\nAt least one table of descriptive statistics\n10\n\n\ngroup_by()\n5\n\n\nsummarize()\n5\n\n\nTotal\n110\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI will investigate the commits made by different authors when evaluating the final project. If it is obvious that one person did not utilize GitHub, and instead added all of their contributions through a single or only a few commits, I will dock points from that individual. There should be numerous commits by each author, and they should be roughly even in terms of contribution activity (which GitHub has metrics to track, both in terms of the number of commits as well as the number of lines modified)."

While all students should participate, participation is not just talking, and a range of participation activities support learning. Participation might look like speaking aloud in the full class and in small groups as well as submitting questions prior to class or engaging with Discussion posts. We will establish more specific participation guidelines and criteria for contributions in our first weeks of the term.\nExpect and Respect Diversity: All classes at the University of Oregon welcome and respect diverse experiences, perspectives, and approaches. What is not welcome are behaviors or contributions that undermine, demean, or marginalize others based on race, ethnicity, gender, sex, age, sexual orientation, religion, ability, or socioeconomic status. We will value differences and communicate disagreements with respect. We may establish more specific guidelines and protocols to ensure inclusion and equity for all members of our learning community.\nHelp Everyone Learn: Part of how we learn together is by learning from one another. To do this effectively, we need to be patient with each other, identify ways we can assist others, and be open-minded to receiving help and feedback from others. Don‚Äôt hesitate to contact me to ask for assistance or offer suggestions that might help us learn better.\nGuidelines for using Canvas Discussion:\n\nUse subject lines that clearly communicate the content of your post - Write concisely, and be aware that humor or sarcasm doesn‚Äôt always translate in writing.\nBe supportive and considerate when replying to others‚Äô posts. This means avoiding use of jargon or inappropriate language, and it means disagreeing with respect and providing clear rationale or evidence to support your different view.\n\nKeep focused on the topic and reference readings and other class materials to support your points (as applicable).\n\nTry to use correct spelling and grammar and proofread your submissions. After submitting, use the edit feature to make corrections and resubmit (don‚Äôt create a new or duplicate post that corrects your error)."

Ideally, students would work with a dataset that includes variables they are interested in using beyond just this class; however, if students do not have access to a dataset, the instructor will provide one. Students who do not have access to data should plan to meet with the instructor as soon as possible so a dataset can be provided. Additionally, the dataset must be able to be shared publicly, as the full project will be required to be housed on GitHub and be fully reproducible. If making your data publicly available is a problem for you, please contact the instructor as soon as possible. We can work together to either find a dataset that will work for you, or simulate a dataset that is similar to the data you‚Äôd like to work with in reality (and then all your code should work for the real dataset, but you can share the simulated data with your classmates). Students are required to work in groups of 2-4 people. The final assignment is assigned during the first class, and groups must be finalized by the end of Week 2 (at which point students who have not self-selected into groups will be randomly assigned).\nI will investigate the commits made by different authors when evaluating the final project. If it is obvious that one person did not utilize GitHub, and instead added all of their contributions through a single or only a few commits, I will dock points from that individual. There should be numerous commits by each author, and they should be roughly even in terms of contribution activity (which GitHub has metrics to track, both in terms of the number of commits as well as the number of lines modified).  \n\n\nOutline (15 points)\nA basic outline of the final project is due at the end of Week 5. The outline should include a description of the data to be used, a discussion of what preparatory work will need to be done, and how the requirements of the final project will be met. The outline is intended to be low-stakes and is primarily designed to be a means for you to obtain feedback on the feasibility of the project and areas to consider.  \n\n\nDraft Data Preparation Script (25 points)\nAt the end of Week 8, you must have a draft of the data preparation complete, including moving the data from its raw to tidy form and a variety of exploratory data visualizations. Final project must use the following functions: pivot_longer(), select(), filter(), mutate(), pivot_wider(), group_by(), and summarize().  \n\n\nPeer Review of Data Preparation Script (25 points)\nFollowing the submission of the data preparation scripts, you will be assigned to review your peers‚Äô code. The purpose of this exercise is to learn from each other. Programming is an immensely open-ended enterprise and there are lots of winding paths that all ultimately end up at the same destination. During your peer review, you must note (a) at least three areas of strength, (b) at least one thing you learned from reviewing their script, and (c) at least one and no more than three areas for improvement. Making your code publicly available can feel daunting. The purpose of this portion of the final project is to help us all learn from each other, not to denigrate. Under no circumstances will negative comments be tolerated. Any comments that could be perceived as negative, and outside the scope of the code, will result in an immediate score of zero. Be constructive in your feedback. Be kind. We are all learning.  \n\n\nFinal Project Presentation (25 points)\nEach group will present on their final project during Week 10, which is expected to still be in progress. These presentations are expected to be informal, and emphasize what learning occurred during the project. Specifically, the presentations are to commiserate with each other about the failures and challenges experienced along the way, while also celebrating the successes. Learning R is a difficult task, and we should all take solace knowing that others are struggling along with us. The final presentation should be equal parts ‚Äújourney‚Äù and substantive findings/conclusions/results. Students are expected to present for approximately 10 minutes each (20-40 minutes per group), although the time may change depending on the enrollment of the class.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresentation Rubric\n\n\nCriteria\nPoints possible\n\n\n\n\nChallenges faced along the way\n5\n\n\nVictories and things to celebrate\n5\n\n\nChallenges you are still facing\n5\n\n\nSubstantive findings/interpretations\n5\n\n\nNext R hurdle to tackle\n5\n\n\nTotal\n25\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Paper (110)\nThe purpose of the final project is to allow students an opportunity to demonstrate all the skills they have learned throughout the course. The final project must (a) be a reproducible and dynamic R Markdown document with references to the extant literature; (b) be housed on GitHub, with contributions from all authors obvious; (c) demonstrate moving data from its raw ‚Äúmessy‚Äù format to a tidy data format through the R Markdown file, but not in the final document; (d) include at least two exploratory data visualizations, and (e) include at least summary statistics of the data in tables, although fitted models of any sort are an added bonus (not literally, there are not extra points for fitting a model). The points for the final project are broken down as follows.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Paper Rubric\n\n\nCriteria\nPoints Possible\n\n\n\n\nWriting\n\n\n\nAbstract\n5\n\n\nIntroduction\n5\n\n\nMethods\n5\n\n\nResults\n5\n\n\nDiscussion\n5\n\n\nReferences\n5\n\n\nCode\n\n\n\nDocument is fully reproducible\n25\n\n\nDemonstrate use of inline code\n5\n\n\nAt least two data visualizations\n10 (5 pts each)\n\n\nDemonstrate tidying messy data using:\n\n\n\npivot_longer()\n5\n\n\nmutate()\n5\n\n\nselect() and filter()\n5\n\n\npivot_wider()\n5\n\n\nAt least one table of descriptive statistics\n10\n\n\ngroup_by()\n5\n\n\nsummarize()\n5\n\n\nTotal\n110"

Do you notice any strong differences by party affiliation?\n\n\nModify the plot from Question 4 to produce separate ridgeline densities by race within one plot. Do you see any patterns?\n\n\nReplicate the plots from Questions 4 and 5, but this time displaying the relations with boxplots (i.e., one boxplot from Question 4 and one boxplot for Question 5 in the chunk below). Try using coord_flip. Which do you think displays the relation more clearly?
